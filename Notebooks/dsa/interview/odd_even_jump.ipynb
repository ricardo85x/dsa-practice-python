    "# Odd Even Jump\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array `arr`. \n",
    "\n",
    "From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called **odd-numbered jumps**, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called **even-numbered jumps**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jump Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "You may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Odd-numbered jumps** (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...): You jump to the index `j` such that:\n",
    "  - `arr[i] <= arr[j]` \n",
    "  - `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value.\n",
    "  - If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Even-numbered jumps** (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...): You jump to the index `j` such that:\n",
    "  - `arr[i] >= arr[j]`\n",
    "  - `arr[j]` is the largest possible value.\n",
    "  - If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **starting index** is **good** if, \n",
    "\n",
    "starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array \n",
    "\n",
    "(index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping \n",
    "\n",
    "some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of **good starting indices**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- From starting index `i = 0`, we can make our 1st jump to `i = 2` (since `arr[2]` is the smallest among `arr[1]`, `arr[2]`, `arr[3]`, `arr[4]` that is greater or equal to `arr[0]`), then we cannot jump anymore.\n",
    "- From starting index `i = 1` and `i = 2`, we can make our 1st jump to `i = 3`, then we cannot jump anymore.\n",
    "- From starting index `i = 3`, we can make our 1st jump to `i = 4`, so we have reached the end.\n",
    "- From starting index `i = 4`, we have reached the end already.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, there are **2** different starting indices `i = 3` and `i = 4`, where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- From starting index `i = 0`, we make jumps to `i = 1`, `i = 2`, `i = 3`:\n",
    "  - During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to `i = 1` because `arr[1]` is the smallest value in `[arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]]` that is greater than or equal to `arr[0]`.\n",
    "  - During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from `i = 1` to `i = 2` because `arr[2]` is the largest value in `[arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]]` that is less than or equal to `arr[1]`. `arr[3]` is also the largest value, but `2` is a smaller index, so we can only jump to `i = 2` and not `i = 3`.\n",
    "  - During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from `i = 2` to `i = 3` because `arr[3]` is the smallest value in `[arr[3], arr[4]]` that is greater than or equal to `arr[2]`.\n",
    "  - We can't jump from `i = 3` to `i = 4`, so the starting index `i = 0` is not good.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a similar manner, we can deduce that:\n",
    "  - From starting index `i = 1`, we jump to `i = 4`, so we reach the end.\n",
    "  - From starting index `i = 2`, we jump to `i = 3`, and then we can't jump anymore.\n",
    "  - From starting index `i = 3`, we jump to `i = 4`, so we reach the end.\n",
    "  - From starting index `i = 4`, we are already at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, there are **3** different starting indices `i = 1`, `i = 3`, and `i = 4`, where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reach the end from starting indices `1`, `2`, and `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 10^4`\n",
    "- `0 <= arr[i] < 10^5`\n",
