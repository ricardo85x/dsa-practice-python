# DSA Practice in Python with Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains my journey of practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python. The exercises are solved in Jupyter Notebooks to make the code easy to follow and test interactively.

## Overview

In this repository, I am solving a variety of DSA problems, ranging from basic algorithms to more advanced topics. The solutions are written in Python, and each problem is explored in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to not only improve my coding skills but also deepen my understanding of algorithms and their applications.

## Folder Structure

- `Notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with solved DSA problems.
  - Each notebook is focused on a specific topic or problem.
  - The notebooks are organized by topic such as arrays, linked lists, sorting algorithms, dynamic programming, etc.
- `README.md`: This file, which explains the structure and purpose of the repository.

## Topics Covered

- **Arrays**: Basic operations, searching, sorting, sliding window techniques.
- **Linked Lists**: Single, doubly linked lists, reversing, merging.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Stack implementation, queue implementation, and applications.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversals.
- **Graphs**: DFS, BFS, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, etc.
- **Backtracking**: N-queens, Sudoku solver, etc.
- **Recursion**: Fibonacci, factorials, and other recursive problems.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ricardo85x/dsa-practice-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Notebooks/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd dsa-practice-python/Notebooks
   ```

3. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. The notebook will open in your default browser, and you can run each cell interactively to explore the solutions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, you should have Python and Jupyter installed. You can set up the environment by following these steps:

1. Install Python (version 3.7 recommended): [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install Jupyter Notebook using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. You can also create a virtual environment for better dependency management:
   ```bash
   python -m venv dsa-env
   source dsa-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `dsa-env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
